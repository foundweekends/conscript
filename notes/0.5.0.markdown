conscript (`cs`) is moved to [foundweekends][fw], an organization for people who like coding in the weekend.

### CONSCRIPT_HOME changes

Starting 0.5.0, scripts are created under `$CONSCRIPT_HOME/bin` instead of `$HOME/bin`. Please adjust your `PATH` accordingly.

You can now use the environment variable `CONSCRIPT_HOME` to control where conscript downloads things (default: `$HOME/.conscript`).
The directory where the scripts will be created can also be controlled via `CONSCRIPT_BIN` envonment variable. As noted above, the default value is `$CONSCRIPT_HOME/bin`.

    export CONSCRIPT_HOME="$HOME/.conscript"
    export CONSCRIPT_OPTS="-XX:MaxPermSize=512M -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"
    export PATH=$CONSCRIPT_HOME/bin:$PATH
